## ✨ Vision

Most people set goals. Very few **design who they want to become**.

FutureSelf.id helps users:
- Define their **future identity**
- Break it into **skills, habits, and milestones**
- Track their **personal evolution**
- Reflect on progress over **months and years**, not just days

We believe:
> If you can clearly see your future self, you can start becoming them today.
